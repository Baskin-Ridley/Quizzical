# Quizzical
This is a quiz web-app that I completed as the final solo project for the [Scrimba React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) , which taught me **React States**, **React Hooks**, and **React Forms** as well as various other important React skills.

This project uses the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) to provide the questions. With many features such as: player chosen options including trivia category and difficulty.
